            <h4>VISUAL CREATIVITY</h4>
              There's more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than
              focusing on block style information architecture, you can create 
              refreshing and engaging visual such as animations or  beautiful
              photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to
              scroll further down the page

              Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. it's
              now less about click and more about scrolling swiping and tapping,
              Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,
              providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.

              Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor
              website browser, as it forces business to convey their
              message and vision into one dynamic web design page.

          These days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an
          instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page
          requires through and motivation. A single page website
          allows user to identify their purpose on  the website quicker
          than needing to sift through multiple page.

           <pre>
          One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that
          they are not SEO friendly.Why? When you limit the number of
          pages on your websites, Google has fewer pages to index and
          negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results
          page(SERP).Lucky there are ways around this.

          <pre>
            50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the
            more high resolution imagery and animation you include, the longer it takes to
            load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular Parallax
            websites, and found that one with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to
            load an a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll website
            loaded within a few seconds.

            Instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back
            up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to
            refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is
            to include top navigation and have each element anchored
            to a category or section.
